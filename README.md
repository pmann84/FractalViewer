# FractalViewer
This is a simple fractal viewer written in C++ using SFML for graphics and ImGui for interactivity.

## Info
- Multithreaded CPU based fractal renderer
- Ability to pick from predefined colour palettes (limited - need to add more)
- Ability to render different fractals (hardcoded to render only Mandelbrot and Julia sets)
- Ability to choose different colouring algorithms (limited to escape-time and continuous potential)
